## About

Minimal document template based on Vite and Preact and takes inspiration from
[antidote.sh](https://antidote.sh)

### Features

- Based on [Vite](https://vite.dev/), so handles basic dev tooling for you.
- Tiny layer on top of [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), so the overall js bundle in tiny.
- Tries to be "Just Javascript" instead of magically hiding everything
